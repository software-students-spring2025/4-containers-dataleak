# Containerized App Exercise

# Virtual Fridge

## Project Description

Virtual Fridge is a food tracking application that helps users keep track of food they have at home. With a photo, this app can automatically categorize foods and store foods in a user's virtual fridge. User's will be able to create an account and login to view their virtual fridge wherever they go.

1. **Machine Learning Client**
   - Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to recognize different foods via the user's webcam.
2. **Web App**
   - Built with flask, it allows users to set up an account, add different foods, and view those foods.
3. **MongoDB**
   - Database for storing user information and food items.
